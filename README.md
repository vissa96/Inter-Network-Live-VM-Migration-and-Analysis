# Inter-Network-Live-VM-Migration-and-Analysis

We hereby present our project on the topic Live VM Migration and its Analysis.
The project phases into sections describing VM migration and its types, the common
techniques followed for VM migration and its issues pertaining to the same. Further
on, we introduce the various tools mandatory for Live VM migration. These phase
out into KVM, QEMU, Libvirt, VXLAN and Open vSwitch. Finally we present our
practical on various projects carried out during different semesters. We began with
a Live VM Migration across the same subnet. Then moved on to live VM migration
across different subnets using NAT and finally live VM migration across different
subnets using bridged mode. Towards the end we provide a comparative analysis on
the same. This project provides a good pedestal to readers who wish to understand
the concepts of VM migration specific to its applicability in data centers and also
illustrates a detailed step by step procedure to conduct a Live VM migration across
subnets using personal computers. We also declare that we have taken help from
the Internet whose references have been stated in references. We have also taken
immense help and guidance from our mentors Prof. Neeraj Tyagi and Dr. Mayank
Pandey. We hope this thesis proves helpful to its readers.
